        <em>Coming home</em> is terrible whether the dog licks your face or not
        whether you have a wife or just a wife-shaped loneliness waiting for you
        <em>coming home</em> is terribly lonely so that you'll think of the
        oppressive barometric pressure back where you've just come from with
        fondness, because everything is worse once you're home.
     </wow> </p>


    <p>
      <ooh>
      You think of the vermin clinging to the grass stalks, long hours on the
      road, roadside assistance and ice-creams, and the peculiar shapes of
      certain clouds and silences with longing because you did not want to
      return coming home is just awful. And the home-style silences and clouds
      contribute to nothing but the general malaise. Clouds, such as they are,
      are in fact suspect, and made from a different material than those you
      left behind. You yourself were cut from a different cloudy cloth,
      returned, remaindered, ill-met by moonlight, unhappy to be back, slack in
      all the wrong spots, seamy suit of clothes dishrag-ratty, worn.
    </ooh></p>



    <p>
      You return home moon-landed, foreign; the Earth’s gravitational pull an
      effort now redoubled, dragging your shoelaces loose and your shoulders
      etching deeper the stanza of worry on your forehead. You return home
      deepened, a parched well linked to tomorrow by a frail strand of…
    </p>
   

    <p>Anyway…</p>

    <p>
      You sigh into the onslaught of identical days. One might as well, at a
      time…
    </p>

    <p>Well… Anyway… You’re back.</p>

    <p>
      The sun goes up and down like a tired whore, the weather immobile like a
      broken limb while you just keep getting older. Nothing moves but the
      shifting tides of salt in your body. Your vision blears. You carry your
      weather with you, the big blue whale, a skeletal darkness.
    </p>

    <p>
      You come back with X-ray vision. Your eyes have become a hunger. You come
      home with your mutant gifts to a house of bone. Everything you see now,
      all of it: bone.
